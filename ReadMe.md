About this App:

This app uses google authentication to Sign Up/Login. Without a successful login, you will receive 'Access Denied' to the Dashboard. Also for security purposes, the session will time out after an hour. Between this and using MongoDB for our database, it ensures you and only you will have access to your notes.







"Write additional notes or explanations explaining the difficulties of this development process and what you learned from the process":

This project was...well fun defintely isn't the right word to describe it, but at moments it was. I felt that creating this app helped me understand what we've been learning and how it all ties in together. I feel I still struggle with a lot of it, but this project helped make sense of a few parts, therfore giving me some hope! 

That being said, there we're dificulties. Like a lot haha.
- I ran into a PORT issue right off the hop. Didn't seem to matter what port I used, they were all 'Busy.' But eventually found the 5001 so went with that 
- There were times during this project where i'd be stuck on an error. Trying to pin-point where the terminal was telling me it was, and also what it meant I found difficult.
- And for about 85% of those errors, I learned how important having the correct spelling and order of numbers are. Couldn't tell you how long it took me to figure out that I misspelled 'Dashboard'
- With all the different files and folders, I had a hard time knowing what section of code goes where, and ultimately why.
- Sometimes even though I was already logged in, I would click Dashboard but I would get the error 'Access Denied' which is set to show if you're not logged in
- When it came to the Github uploading, I didn't know what to do - Thank you G for your guidence on this one or it might not ever be uploaded
- while trying to upload the repository, we noticed the .gitignore was still showing the listed folders

But with problems, we learn and thanks to the world wide web, and some helpful sites/people, I was able to make my way through this project. And learning the whole time I did so.

Thank you!
